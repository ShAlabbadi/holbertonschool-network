📖 Overview
The process of loading a webpage involves multiple systems working together in milliseconds. Here's the complete journey:

🔄 Step-by-Step Process
1. URL Parsing
Browser parses the URL: https://www.google.com

Protocol: https:// (secure HTTP)

Domain: www.google.com

Port: Default 443 for HTTPS

2. DNS Lookup 🌐
Purpose: Translate human-readable domain to IP address

Process:

Check browser cache

Check OS cache (/etc/hosts on Linux)

Check router cache

Query ISP's DNS recursive resolver

Root DNS server → TLD server (.com) → Authoritative name servers

Returns IP address (e.g., 142.251.32.196)

DNS Record Types:

A Record: IPv4 address

AAAA Record: IPv6 address

CNAME: Alias to another domain

MX: Mail servers

3. TCP/IP Connection 🔌
Three-Way Handshake:

text
Client → Server: SYN (Synchronize)
Server → Client: SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge) 
Client → Server: ACK (Acknowledge)
Establishes reliable connection

Uses port 443 for HTTPS

4. Firewall Check 🛡️
Network security system monitoring traffic

Checks if port 443 traffic is allowed

Verifies packet headers against security rules

Can be hardware or software-based

5. HTTPS/SSL TLS Handshake 🔒
SSL/TLS Handshake Process:

Client Hello: Supported cipher suites, TLS version

Server Hello: Selected cipher suite, SSL certificate

Certificate Verification: CA validation, expiration check

Key Exchange: Pre-master secret encrypted with server's public key

Session Keys: Generate symmetric encryption keys

Encrypted Communication: All data encrypted end-to-end

6. Load Balancer ⚖️
Purpose: Distribute traffic across multiple servers

Algorithms:

Round Robin

Least Connections

IP Hash

Geographic-based

Google's Load Balancing:

Global load balancing across data centers

Health checks on backend servers

SSL termination possible

7. Web Server 🖥️
Examples: Nginx, Apache
Responsibilities:

Serve static content (HTML, CSS, JS, images)

Reverse proxy to application servers

Compression (gzip)

Caching headers

Virtual host configuration

8. Application Server 🚀
Examples: Custom Google servers, Node.js, Python Django, Java Spring
Responsibilities:

Business logic execution

User authentication

Session management

API endpoints

Template rendering

9. Database 🗄️
Google's Infrastructure:

Bigtable (NoSQL)

Spanner (globally distributed SQL)

Custom distributed databases

Operations:

Query processing

Index lookups

Transaction management

Replication and sharding
